How to use it.. 
clone the repo and run "java -jar GraphTest.jar"
Then add the "graph" 
e.g "AB5, BC4, CD7, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7"

Then input the option you want query i.e "R" for specific route, or 'NR' for number of routes
Then add the query 
i.e AC, CC etc.

Options :
-R      : Route
-D      : Shortest Distance
-SR     : Shortest Route
-SRD    : Shortest Route and Distance
-SJM    : Maximum Number of Junction
-SJE    : Exact Number of Junction
-NR     : Number of Routes


FOR OPTION SJM, SJE, NR

you have to input a number after the query 
i.e CC 30, 
where the number is the number of junction for SJE and SJM 
or 
number is the maximum distance for NR
